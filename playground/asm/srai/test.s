# Shift Right Arithmetic Immediate
# Format:
#	SRAI RD, RS1, IMM
# Description:
# 	The immediate value determines the number of bits to shift. The contents of
#	RS1 is shifted right that many bits and the result is placed in RD. The shift
#	is “arithmetic”, i.e., the sign bit is repeatedly shifted in on the
#	most-significant end.
# Comment:
#	In C, for signed integer, >> is shift right with arithmetic.
