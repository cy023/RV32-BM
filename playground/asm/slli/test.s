# Shift Left Logical Immediate
# Format:
#	SLLI RD, RS1, IMM
# Description:
#	The immediate value determines the number of bits to shift. The contents 
#	of RS1 is shifted left that many bits and the result is placed in RD. 
#	The bits shifted in are filled with zero.
#	For 32-bit machines, the shift amount must be within 0..31, 0 means no 
#	shifting is done.
