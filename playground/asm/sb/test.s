# Store Byte
# Format:
#	SB RS2, IMM(RS1)
# Description:
#	An 8-bit value is copied from register RS2 to memory. The upper (more
#	significant) bits in RS2 are ignored. The memory address is formed by 
#	adding the offset(IMM) to the contents of RS1.
# Note: 
#	Due to IMM is 12 bits width, the target location given by the 
#	offset(IMM) must be within the range of -2,048 .. 2,047 relative to the
#	value in RS1.
