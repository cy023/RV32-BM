# Add Upper Immediate to PC
# Format:
#	AUIPC RD, IMM
# Description:
#	AUIPC is used to build pc-relative addresses and uses the U-type format. 
#	AUIPC forms a 32-bit offset from the 20-bit U-immediate, filling in the 
#	lowest 12 bits with zeros, adds this offset to the address of the AUIPC 
#	instruction, then places the result in register RD.
# Note:
#	The current PC can be obtained by setting the U-immediate to 0.

.text					# Define beginning of text section
.global	_start			# Define entry _start

_start:
	auipc x5, 0x12345	# x5 = PC + (0x12345 << 12)
	
	auipc x6, 0			# x6 = PC, to obtain the current PC

stop:
	j stop				# Infinite loop to stop execution

.end					# End of file
